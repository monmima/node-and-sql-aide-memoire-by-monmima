## Node.js + SQL

This project was influenced by Brad Traversy's tutorial on MySQL and Node.js. It's called [Using MySQL With Node.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN6Dx22cPRI).

It was also influenced by my [Node and MongoDB CRUD aide-mémoire](https://github.com/monmima/node-and-mongodb-crud-aide-memoire-by-monmima).

It's an aide-mémoire for myself, but maybe you'll find it useful too!
