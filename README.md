## Node.js + SQL

This project was influenced by Brad Traversy's tutorial on MySQL and Node.js. It's called [Using MySQL With Node.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN6Dx22cPRI).

It was also influenced by my [Node and MongoDB CRUD aide-mémoire](https://github.com/monmima/node-and-mongodb-crud-aide-memoire-by-monmima).

It's an aide-mémoire for myself, but maybe you'll find it useful too!

## EJS: You don't want to learn it for now? No problem!

There are a few pages of the site/app using EJS.

If you don't want to learn EJS from the get-go or if you don't want to be overwhelmed as a newcomer to MySQL and Node.js, just don't take into account this part of the code. It is **NOT** used all over the place in the project.

Once you feel comfortable with Node.js and MySQL, then you'll be ready for EJS. EJS is a templating tool that enables you to insert data from your database into .ejs files, which are then rendered into HTML. The simplest form of EJS would be a regular old HTML page, but with an .ejs extension (but of course, that would be pointless).
